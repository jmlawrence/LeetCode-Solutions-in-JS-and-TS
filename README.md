# LeetCode in JavaScript and TypeScript and Python

## About

A simple repo with LeetCode solutions in JS and TS.
Contributions are welcome!

The format:

```
// {Problem #}. {Problem Title} (i.e. 206. Reverse Linked List)

// Problem description

// The solution
```

## Annotations and comments

Annotations and comments within the solution are welcome.
After all, understanding the solutions is critical.

## Alternate solutions

If the a solution is the same in approach, but cleaner or
more efficient; merely update the core algorithm file.
However, if handling in a non-simililar approach (iterative
versus recursive) - then modify the original file name and
add a new file to reflect the differences, i.e. `1. Two Sum
(Recurrsive).js` and `1. Two Sum (Iterative).js`.

## Naming conventions of files

Use the number and name of the LeetCode problem: `1. Two Sum (Iterative).js`.
