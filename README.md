# LeetCode in JavaScript and TypeScript and Python

## About

A simple repo with LeetCode solutions in JS and TS.
Contributions are welcome!

The format:

```
// {Problem #}. {Problem Title} (i.e. 206. Reverse Linked List)

// Problem description

// The solution
```

## Annotations and comments

Annotations and comments within the solution are welcome.
After all, understanding the solutions is critical.

## Alternate solutions

If the a solution is the same in approach, but cleaner or
more efficient; merely update the core algorithm file.
However, if handling in a non-simililar approach (iterative
versus recursive) - then modify the original file name and
add a new file to reflect the differences, i.e. `1. Two Sum
(Recurrsive).js` and `1. Two Sum (Iterative).js`.

## Naming conventions of files

Use the name of the LeetCode problem (excluding the number
in the name of the file). Since the number is contained in
the file, it remains searchable if needed.
