# {{Problem #88}: {Problem Title}

# Problem description
#
# You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order,
# and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
#
# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function,
# but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
#
# To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, 
# and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
#/

# Example 1:
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
#Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
# The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

# The solution ---------------------------}
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        while m > 0 and n > 0:
            if nums1[m - 1] >= nums2[n - 1]:
                nums1[m + n - 1] = nums1[m - 1]
                m -= 1
            else:
                nums1[m + n - 1] = nums2[n - 1]
                n -= 1
        # if n > 0 at this point then all elements left in nums2 should replace the placeholder 0's in nums1 at the end of the list
        if n > 0:
            nums1[:n] = nums2[:n]
