// 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

// You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

// The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

// For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

// Example 1:

// Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
// Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
// Explanation:
// The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
// Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
// We return the new list after removing this node.
// Example 2:

// Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: [1,2,4]
// Explanation:
// The above figure represents the given linked list.
// For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
// Example 3:

// Input: head = [2,1]
// Output: [2]
// Explanation:
// The above figure represents the given linked list.
// For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
// Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
