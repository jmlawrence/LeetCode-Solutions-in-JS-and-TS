    // As Wegner described in 1960,[13] the bitwise AND of x ...
    // ... with x âˆ’ 1 differs from x only in zeroing out the least ...
    // ... significant nonzero bit: subtracting 1 changes the rightmost ...
    // ... string of 0s to 1s, and changes the rightmost 1 to a 0. 
    // If x originally had n bits that were 1, then after only n iterations ... 
    // ... of this operation, x will be reduced to zero.
